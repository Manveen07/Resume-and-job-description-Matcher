# Resume-and-job-description-Matcher
In this project, we developed a system to match resumes to a job posting and identify the most relevant
resumes using Gen-AI tools in Python. The objective is to simulate a real-world scenario where recruiters
need to filter through multiple resumes to find the best candidates for a given job.
The resumes are scored based on how well they align with the job description. The scoring criteria are
as follows:
• 10: Not relevant to the job description.
• 7-9: Relevant but lacks some specific experience or skills.
• 4-6: Partially relevant with significant gaps in skills or experience.
• 1-3: Strongly relevant but needs minor adjustments.
• 0: Highly relevant and well-matched with the job requirements.
Each resume was scored on these criteria, and the final scores were used to rank the resumes.
